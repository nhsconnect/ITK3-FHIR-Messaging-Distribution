## Overview ##

Error information in the Acknowledgement Response messages is carried in the MessageHeader Resource and the OperationOutcome Resource. There are several elements and their value sets used to carry error information in these resources. The ITK Payload Specifications may define the error handling behaviour of the clinical application/system and communicates errors using the ITK Business Acknowledgements.

Care Professionals need to be informed that a Document has not reached, or is experiencing difficulty in reaching, its intended recipients. 
This page describes how error information is carried. The example fragments are used to illustrate the elements and value sets used and are not complete messages. 


## Elements And Value Sets Used To Carry Error Information ##

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Value Set</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MessageHeader</td>
<td>response.code</td>
<td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-response-code.html" target="_blank">response-code</a></td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The MessageHeader carries a code to indicate success or failure. The ITK error codes must be mapped to the high-level element codes carried in the severity, code and details elements of the OperationOutcome. The mapping Table below shows how the three levels of codes should be utilised. 

**Note**: When a bundle is incorrectly constructed or received so that the value of the infrastructure acknowledgement flag cannot be determined, receiving systems SHOULD default to always returning an acknowledgement wherever possible. 

## Mapping FHIR Error Codes to ITK3 Error Codes ##

## Distribution Level Errors ##

These errors should be returned to the sender using the Infrastructure Acknowledgement message.

**Minimum requirements that MUST be supported by receiving systems.**

## Scenario - Unreadable Message Error Scenario ##

When a system receives a message which is totally unreadable due to it being corrupted or malformed, there is a default behaviour defined which systems should support. This behaviour for information unobtainable from the handling keys and header elements is listed below:

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain if an acknowledgement has been requested.

**Default Behaviour** - An acknowledgement must always be returned to the sender.

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain sender person or organisation.

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement to MESH mailbox original message was sent from and original sending system will have to deal with acknowledgement the best it can. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain whether original message was for action or only for information.

**Default Behaviour** - Assume for action and return acknowledgement.

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain priority of original message.

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement as soon as possible once error is detected. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain any other information

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement as soon as possible once error is detected. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain the identifier of the original message.

**Default Behaviour** - return the fixed string of "UNREADABLE-IN-ORIGINAL-MESSAGE"

Note: If only certain elements are missing or unreadable then the error codes associated with that key or element should be returned instead wherever possible.
