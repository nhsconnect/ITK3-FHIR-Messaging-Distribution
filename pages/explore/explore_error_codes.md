## Overview ##

Error information in the Acknowledgement Response messages is carried in the MessageHeader Resource and the OperationOutcome Resource. There are several elements and their value sets used to carry error information in these resources. The ITK Payload Specifications may define the error handling behaviour of the clinical application/system and communicates errors using the ITK Business Acknowledgements.

Care Professionals need to be informed that a Document has not reached, or is experiencing difficulty in reaching, its intended recipients. 
This page describes how error information is carried. The example fragments are used to illustrate the elements and value sets used and are not complete messages. 


## Elements And Value Sets Used To Carry Error Information ##

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Value Set</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MessageHeader</td>
<td>response.code</td>
<td><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-response-code.html" target="_blank">response-code</a></td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The MessageHeader carries a code to indicate success or failure. The ITK error codes must be mapped to the high-level element codes carried in the severity, code and details elements of the OperationOutcome. The mapping Table below shows how the three levels of codes should be utilised. 

**Note**: When a bundle is incorrectly constructed or received so that the value of the infrastructure acknowledgement flag cannot be determined, receiving systems SHOULD default to always returning an acknowledgement wherever possible. 

## Mapping FHIR Error Codes to ITK3 Error Codes ##

## Distribution Level Errors ##

These errors should be returned to the sender using the Infrastructure Acknowledgement message.

**Minimum requirements that MUST be supported by receiving systems.**

## Examples of Error Codes in Responses ##

**Ok at the infrastructure level**

This uses the MessageHeader resource to carry the code.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/b6678b59daaa95a18fd4f808b0e8f32d.js"></script>

**Error at the infrastructure level**

This uses the MessageHeader and the OperationOutcome resources.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/ff82904e958c68c28db73139a47b6911.js"></script>

**Ok at the business level**

This uses the MessageHeader and the OperationOutcome resources.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/846a7953fe122b9f811e14f06a5752c1.js"></script>

**Error at the business level due to patient not registered**

This uses the MessageHeader and the OperationOutcome resources

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/7591e3aa10e414b600ac2d786f6f33c2.js"></script>
