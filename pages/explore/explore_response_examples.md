## Infrastructure Level Response 10009: Fatal-Error - Unreadable Message Received ##

When a system receives a message which is totally unreadable due to it being corrupted or malformed, there is a default behaviour defined which systems should support. This behaviour for information unobtainable from the handling keys and header elements is listed below:

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain if an acknowledgement has been requested.

**Default Behaviour** - An acknowledgement must always be returned to the sender.

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain sender person or organisation.

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement to MESH mailbox original message was sent from and original sending system will have to deal with acknowledgement the best it can. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain whether original message was for action or only for information.

**Default Behaviour** - Assume for action and return acknowledgement.

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain priority of original message.

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement as soon as possible once error is detected. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain any other information

**Default Behaviour** - Return acknowledgement as soon as possible once error is detected. 

----------

**Issue** - Unable to ascertain the identifier of the original message.

**Default Behaviour** - return the fixed string of "UNREADABLE-IN-ORIGINAL-MESSAGE"

Note: If only certain elements are missing or unreadable then the error codes associated with that key or element should be returned instead wherever possible.
